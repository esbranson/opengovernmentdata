-- Quarterly Data Layout --

Quarterly data are stored by quarter in CSV files. Four archives
contain files using this format. For Example quarterly data for
2001 are stored in the following archives:

    2001.q1-q4.by_area.zip
    2001.q1-q4.by_industry.zip
    2001.q1-q4.singlefile.zip
    2001.q1.by_size.zip 
    
Note: 
1) Size data are only published for the first quarter of each year
2) The single file does not contain title fields (9 through 13).
